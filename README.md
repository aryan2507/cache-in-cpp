Implementation of Cache in C++

The cache can store any type of object required. 
The cache is indexed using integer.
This is implemented using template. 

You can choose from three different schemes-
1. LRU
2. FIFO
3. LIFO
Other schemes can be implemented using the already constructed
using the functions implemented in the cache class.

The cache is made thread safe using reader-writer locks.
